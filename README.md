# Perlin Noise Flow Field
Perlin Noise Flow Field used to create a "random" black and white particle effect.

![Perlin Noise Flow Field Example](/img/Example.png)

This is a Perlin Noise Flow Field. Using [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), I was able to create a particle flow field. Each time the program is run, particle are generated at the middle y-axis of the screen and flow in any direction given to them via the flow field.

This project was the final version of code I submitted for an 11th grade Math honors assignment I had in 2016. The goal was to teach myself unique coding concepts, and I quickly was interested in Perlin Noise and what it can be used for. I followed many tutorials by [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) on his Youtube channel, [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). The specific project followed is his series on Perlin Noise which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf4dIN99e2w&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD). Feel free to use my code however you please.

## How to Run:

Download the repo to your computer, and click on the ```index.html``` till it opens. Each time you refresh, you should see a different iteration of the image be created.
